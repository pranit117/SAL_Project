# SAL_Project
By Pranit Khanna (2021101057) and Monica Surtani (2023802005)  
The slides are already shared so not covering the project here.  
The syllables for non-native dataset is present is SYLLABLESTRESS2  
X_test and X_train consist of testing and training features respectively. (I do not remember which test this is since it was very convenient for me to switch between native and non-native test sets while running the code but I can provide both later if required.) Along with Y_test and Y_train consisting of their respective gold stress markings.  
data.pkl is the training syllables that were used.  
features.ipynb consists of extracting features and some analysis presented in the slides.  
model_training.ipynb was for training models ( stress level 2 for mfa was converted to 1 so make sure to run those cells) along with some report generation.  
Please make a note that some graphs and results may vary from the slides but that is because some experiments were being conducted by me but the results shown in the slides are only valid.
